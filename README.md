# Yet another Space Invaders in python

This is a Python script utilizing [Turtle graphics library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html) to simulate famous Space Invaders game.

I used this code to teach Python to my kid. It is using some tips and two image file from one of the hundreds of tutorials on the web (I really can't remember which one, otherwise I would link to it).

Comments and variables' names in the code are in Estonian.
